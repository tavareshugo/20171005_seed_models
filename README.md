# Fitting population-based models to seed germination

This repo contains some code to try and fit Kent Bradford's population-based 
model of seed germination (in [Bradford 1990](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/94/2/840) 
and references therein).

See [this page](https://rawgit.com/tavareshugo/20171005_seed_models/master/R/notebooks/test_seed_population_models.html)
with the strategies trialed so far.
